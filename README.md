# Demons and Doom
`An OC-based magic ability repository for Hideous Destructor.`

This mod obviously requires [HDGreens](https://github.com/Renegade4339/HDGreens) to work.

### Why an expansion pack?
> You could've just added them into your base mod, right?

I would but, the base mod would be cluttered badly, not to mention the base addon\
focuses on granting players abilities from demon attacks.

\
This hasn't gotten any abilities yet but it definitely has\
a to-do list of whose OC ability set to be added here:
- Red's power of gun ability set

- Bjonto's ability set

- herlie's boiling water ability

- [Azura Stella](https://twitch.tv/azurastella)'s OC ability set 
- And then my own OC for this.
